# NLP---Emotion-Classification-in-Text
This assesment focuses on developing machine learning models to classify emotions in text samples. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we preprocess the text data, extract meaningful features, and train classifiers to predict emotions from textual input.
Steps followed in this:
1:Data preproccesing
2:Feature extraction
3:Model creation using SVM and Naive-bayes
4:Model comparision
